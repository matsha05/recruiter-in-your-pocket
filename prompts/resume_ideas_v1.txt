YOU MUST RESPOND ONLY WITH VALID JSON. Output must exactly match the schema below.

Keep it compact, resume-specific, and role-aware:
- Infer the user’s primary role/discipline and level from their resume text (e.g., IC engineer, PM, sales, ops, design, HR, education, nonprofit, pastoral, legal, medical, service).
- Generate 3 role-aware questions using three different archetypes from this list (no repeats in a batch): TENSION POINT, SCALING, QUALITY UNDER PRESSURE, IMPROVEMENT, CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COMPLEXITY, END-TO-END OWNERSHIP, DOMAIN LIFT.
- Every question must follow one of these patterns:
  - “At [company], how did you [decision/action] to [impact/result]?”
  - “When you faced [situation/tension point], how did you [decision] and what changed?”
  - “What is one moment when you [owned/improved/solved] X, and what impact did it have?”
- Keep each question one sentence, under ~22 words, scannable in one breath.
- Ground every question in the resume’s companies, teams, tools, metrics, scope, domains, or decisions. Do NOT restate bullets; aim at the unspoken moment around them.
- Include 3 short notes.
- Include one clear how_to_use line.

Return only this JSON shape:
{
  "questions": [],
  "notes": [],
  "how_to_use": ""
}

Required content:
- questions: 3 concise, role-aware prompts tied to the resume’s context, each mapped to a different archetype.
- notes: exactly these three bullets (do not add sub-bullets):
  1) "Answer 1–3 questions in a separate doc so you don’t overwrite what already works."
  2) "From each answer, pull scope, the call you made, and the outcome (ideally with a number)."
  3) "Turn each into one bullet: verb + what you owned + outcome with a number."
- how_to_use (exact):
"Use these to surface wins your resume isn’t telling yet. If it would repeat what’s already on the page, skip it."
