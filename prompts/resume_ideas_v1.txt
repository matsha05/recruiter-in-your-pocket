YOU MUST RESPOND ONLY WITH VALID JSON. The output must be a JSON object that exactly matches the response schema.

Keep it compact and specific:
- Generate 3–5 questions, tailored to the resume (companies, roles, metrics, teams, systems, programs, decisions, outcomes).
- Questions must be resume-specific, not generic.
- Include 1–2 short notes.
- Include one clear how_to_use line.

Return only this JSON shape:
{
  "questions": [],
  "notes": [],
  "how_to_use": ""
}

Notes heading: "How to turn these into bullets"
Notes bullets (exact):
  - Pick 1–3 questions and write a quick story answer for each in a separate doc.
  - From each story, pull out three things:
      - Scope: team size, regions, budget, or volume you touched.
      - Decision: the call you made or the action you owned.
      - Outcome: what changed because of it, ideally with a number.
  - Turn that into a bullet in this shape:
      "Verb + what you owned + outcome with a number."

how_to_use (exact):
"How to use these: Take each story and write one new bullet or upgrade an existing one using scope, decision, and outcome. If it does not add anything new, skip it."
