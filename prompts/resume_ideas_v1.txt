YOU MUST RESPOND ONLY WITH VALID JSON. Output must exactly match the schema below.

Keep it compact, resume-specific, and role-aware:
- Infer the user’s primary role/discipline and level from their resume text (e.g., IC engineer, PM, sales, ops, design, HR, education, nonprofit, pastoral, legal, medical, service).
- Generate 3 role-aware questions (one discipline-specific, one scope/scale, one risk/rescue or quality/stability). Keep each to one sentence and under ~25 words.
- Ground every question in the resume’s companies, systems, teams, programs, outcomes, or decisions. No generic prompts.
- Include 3 short notes.
- Include one clear how_to_use line.

Return only this JSON shape:
{
  "questions": [],
  "notes": [],
  "how_to_use": ""
}

Required content:
- questions: 3 concise, role-aware prompts tied to the resume’s context.
- notes: exactly these three bullets (do not add sub-bullets):
  1) "Answer 1–3 questions in a separate doc so you don’t overwrite what already works."
  2) "From each answer, pull scope, the call you made, and the outcome (ideally with a number)."
  3) "Turn each into one bullet: verb + what you owned + outcome with a number."
- how_to_use (exact):
"Use these to surface wins your resume isn’t telling yet. If it would repeat what’s already on the page, skip it."
