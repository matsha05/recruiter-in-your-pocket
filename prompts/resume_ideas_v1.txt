YOU MUST RESPOND ONLY WITH VALID JSON. Output must exactly match the schema below.

Keep it compact, resume-specific, and role-aware:
- Infer the user’s primary role/discipline and level from their resume text (e.g., IC engineer, PM, sales, ops, design, HR, education, nonprofit, pastoral, legal, medical, service).
- Generate 5 role-aware questions using five different archetypes from this list (no repeats in a batch): TENSION POINT, SCALING, QUALITY UNDER PRESSURE, IMPROVEMENT, CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COMPLEXITY, END-TO-END OWNERSHIP, DOMAIN LIFT, HIGH STAKES.
- For each question, include:
  - "question": The prompt question (one sentence, under ~22 words)
  - "archetype": Which archetype this question targets (e.g., "TENSION POINT")
  - "why": Why this matters to recruiters/hiring managers (one sentence explaining the insight it surfaces)
- Ground every question in the resume’s companies, teams, tools, metrics, scope, domains, or decisions. Do NOT restate bullets; aim at the unspoken decision, tradeoff, or before/after that is missing.
- Vary openings and endings; avoid repetitive phrasing.
- Do NOT use “one moment” / “what is one moment” phrasing.

Return only this JSON shape:
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "",
      "archetype": "",
      "why": ""
    }
  ],
  "notes": [],
  "how_to_use": ""
}

Required content:
- questions: 5 objects, each with question, archetype, and why fields
- notes: exactly these three bullets (do not add sub-bullets):
  1) "Answer 1–3 questions in a separate doc so you don’t overwrite what already works."
  2) "From each answer, pull scope, the call you made, and the outcome (ideally with a number)."
  3) "Turn each into one bullet: verb + what you owned + outcome with a number."
- how_to_use (exact):
"Use these to surface wins your resume isn’t telling yet. If it would repeat what’s already on the page, skip it."
