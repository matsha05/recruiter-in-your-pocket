# Todo / Open Issues

## Completed
- [x] Rebuilt backend and restored stable POST /api/resume-feedback  
- [x] Ensured backend works reliably locally  
- [x] Connected frontend and backend cleanly  
- [x] Added JSON structure for strengths, gaps, rewrites, next_steps  
- [x] Implemented rewrite engine with anti-hallucination and clarity rules  
- [x] Added enhancement_note support in backend (JSON)  
- [x] Implemented enhancement_note rendering in frontend  
- [x] Established Mechanism → Scope → Impact rewrite logic  
- [x] Replaced “Pro tip” with brand-aligned “If you have it, include:”  

## High Priority (active development)
- [ ] Continue strengthening rewrite output to feel “elite,” not just cleaned-up wording  
- [ ] Refine enhancement notes so they are contextual, grounded, and always include the “why this helps” clause  
- [ ] Expand cross-background testing (teacher, pastor, lawyer, sales director, marketer, engineer)  
- [ ] Improve summary generation (tone, clarity, uniqueness)  
- [ ] Ensure rewrites remain one sentence but not at the cost of meaning  
- [ ] Add updated context.md sections (rewrite engine + enhancement notes + tone)  
- [ ] Add slight UI polish to enhancement notes (subtle background, left accent line)  

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Improve scoring rubric consistency  
- [ ] Add clearer structure in output card (section dividers, visual rhythm)  
- [ ] Explore auto-expansion for long lists in rewrites  
- [ ] Improve formatting for strengths/gaps lists  
- [ ] Enhance model’s ability to rewrite vague bullets into meaning-rich ones  

## Future Work (post-MVP)
- [ ] Offer negotiation mode  
- [ ] Offer outreach rewriting mode  
- [ ] Activate interview prep mode (currently placeholder)  
- [ ] Introduce role-aware tuning (light heuristics, not hard-coded)  
- [ ] Consider light persona controls (senior vs early-career nuances)
