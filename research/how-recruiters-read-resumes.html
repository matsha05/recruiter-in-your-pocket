        </section>

        <p>
            Most advice about resumes is based on guesswork or recycled tips. This page is based on eye tracking
            research
            that watched recruiters as they reviewed resumes in real time.
        </p>

        <p>
            The study we lean on here is often called the <strong>TheLadders eye tracking study</strong>. It recorded
            where
            recruiters looked on a resume and how long their eyes stayed there.
        </p>

        <h2>The 6 second skim</h2>

        <p>
            The study found that recruiters spend about <strong>6 seconds</strong> on their initial fit or no fit
            decision
            for each resume before deciding whether to keep reading or move on. Later replications and summaries put
            this
            skim window at roughly 6 to 8 seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
            In that time they are not reading every bullet point. They are scanning for fast answers to a few questions:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Who is this person now</li>
            <li>Where do they work</li>
            <li>What is their title</li>
            <li>How long have they been doing it</li>
            <li>Where were they before</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>If those answers are easy to see, your resume earns more attention. If they are hard to see, it is likely
                skipped.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The key data points recruiters look at first</h2>

        <p>Eye tracking heatmaps in the study showed recruiters consistently homing in on:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>Your current title</li>
            <li>Your current company</li>
            <li>Your current dates</li>
            <li>Your previous title</li>
            <li>Your previous company</li>
            <li>Your previous dates</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Everything else was scanned much more lightly. Detail and paragraph copy had little influence on the initial
            decision compared to these basics.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>This means the top of your resume carries more weight than the rest of the page combined.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why dense text hurts you</h2>

        <p>The same study found that resumes with:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Clear section headings</li>
            <li>Consistent formatting</li>
            <li>Clean bullet structure</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            were rated "easier to read" and got more focused attention. Resumes that looked cluttered or inconsistent
            pushed
            recruiters into faster skimming and faster rejection.
        </p>

        <p>
            This lines up with broader usability research on how people scan text on screens. People look for anchors
            like
            headings, bullets, and numbers. Dense paragraphs and mixed ideas in a single bullet tend to get skipped.
        </p>

        <h2>How this shapes Recruiter in Your Pocket</h2>

        <p>We use this research directly in how we design and score your resume:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Recruiter First Impression</strong> sits at the top of your report because that is how important
                the
                first few seconds are.</li>
            <li>Our <strong>main score</strong> focuses on how clearly your recent roles, titles, and scope come across
                in a
                quick skim.</li>
            <li><strong>Top fixes</strong> often prioritize clarifying your most recent role, scope, and outcomes before
                anything else.</li>
            <li><strong>Bullet upgrades</strong> push you toward one idea per bullet, numbers near the front, and clear
                verbs
                so recruiters do not have to dig.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>We are not guessing when we tell you what to change. We are aligning your resume with what eye tracking
                shows
                recruiters actually do.</p>
        </div>
