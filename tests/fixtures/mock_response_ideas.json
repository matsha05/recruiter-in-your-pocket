    "Think of a project where you changed how a team operated: what decision did you make, what changed, and how many people were affected?",
    "Recall a time you reduced risk or rescued a slipping effort: what call did you make, and what measurable recovery followed?",
    "Where did you design or improve a system or process that people still use—what problem did it solve and what scale does it cover now?"

    "Pick 1–3 questions and write a quick story answer for each in a separate doc.",
    "From each story, pull out three things:",
    "Scope: team size, regions, budget, or volume you touched.",
    "Decision: the call you made or the action you owned.",
    "Outcome: what changed because of it, ideally with a number.",
    "Turn that into a bullet in this shape:",
