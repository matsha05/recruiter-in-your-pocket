  "score_comment_short": "Real ownership and impact with a few soft spots.",
  "score_comment_long": "Signal is strong; tighten any buried scope or decisions and make outcomes pop in the top bullets.",
  "summary": "You read as someone who takes messy workstreams and makes them shippable. Your edge is steady ownership: you keep leaders aligned, run the checklist, and make clear calls. You operate with structure and avoid drift even when requirements shift. What is harder to see is the exact scope—teams, volume, dollars—and the before/after change you drove. Trajectory points up if you surface scale and measurable outcomes faster.",
  "strengths": [
    "You keep delivery on track when priorities change and still close the loop with stakeholders.",
    "You use structure (checklists, reviews, comms) so launches and projects avoid drift.",
    "You describe decisions you owned instead of hiding behind “the team.”",
    "You show pattern recognition in how you prevent issues from recurring."

  "gaps": [
    "Scope is muted: number of teams, geos, customers, volume, or dollars touched rarely shows up.",
    "Before/after impact is implied but not stated; add metrics or clear qualitative change.",
    "Some strong bullets blend multiple ideas; split them to let impact land.",
