I am an American certified TEFL teacher, here on a one year student visa, interested in working with children and adults in general and business English. I graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in Family Science. The past two years I worked my way up to manager at Enterprise Rent-a-Car. This experience has prepared me to work with business people. Before Enterprise, I worked children’s camps for six years and I was a nanny. I am confident teaching children since I have so much experience with them. I am comfortable teaching 1–1 and group classes. I have a wide range of experience with people of different ages and backgrounds. I’m reliable, creative, and possess strong communication skills.
