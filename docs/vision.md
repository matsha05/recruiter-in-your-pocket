# Recruiter in Your Pocket — Product Vision

## IDENTITY
Recruiter in Your Pocket is:

> A personal recruiting studio for clarity, confidence, and craft.

This product should feel like an elite recruiter sitting beside the user,
reading their career with calm authority, and handing them a studio-grade
report on their professional story.

Calm is not neutrality. Calm is confidence.
The interface expresses expertise through clarity, not noise.

---

## CORE EXPERIENCE
Every mode in the product must follow the same studio pattern:

1. The user inputs something (resume, offer, or career context).  
2. The studio performs a deep read and outputs an **Insight Stack**:
   - score or band when relevant  
   - “You read as...” interpretation  
   - strengths and gaps  
   - rewrites or decision levers  
   - missing wins or next-step guidance  
3. **Margin Notes** appear beside core insights. These annotations highlight:
   - what matters most  
   - leverage points  
   - thin spots  
   - quick wins  
4. The user leaves with clarity, direction, and confidence.

This must feel like a crafted studio report with expert markup,
not a generic AI output.

## SIGNATURE PATTERN

### 1. INSIGHT STACK
A vertical stack of calm, clean sections.
Each section:
- has one clear takeaway,
- is visually prioritized,
- is spaced with editorial rhythm.

### 2. MARGIN NOTES
Small, intentional annotations that sit beside key sections.
They provide human judgment, emphasis, and clarity about what matters most.

These two together form the product’s signature interaction pattern.

## CORE MODES

1. **Resume Studio**  
   Score, summary, strengths, gaps, stronger bullets, missing wins,
   and concrete next steps.

2. **Offer Studio**  
   Offer competitiveness, comp structure clarity, leverage points,
   risk areas, and negotiation moves.

3. **Interview Studio** (future)  
   Anchor stories, narrative strengths, gaps in story coverage,
   and interview-ready insights.

All three define the product identity and must stay aligned.
