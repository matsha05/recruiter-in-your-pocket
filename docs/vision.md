# Recruiter in Your Pocket — Product Vision

## IDENTITY

Recruiter in Your Pocket is:

> A personal recruiting studio for clarity, confidence, and craft.

This product should feel like an elite recruiter sitting beside the user, 
reading their career with steady authority, and handing them a crafted, premium report.

We are not building an AI toy.  
We are building a studio-grade experience users trust with their story.

The experience should feel:
- crafted, not generic  
- confident, not tentative  
- joyfully clear, not sterile  

Clarity is our foundation.  
Confidence and small moments of delight sit on top of it.

## CORE EXPERIENCE

Every mode must follow the same studio pattern:

### 1. Input
The user brings something meaningful:
- resume  
- offer  
- interview or career context  

### 2. Insight Stack  
The system produces a stack of:
- score or band (when relevant)  
- how their story lands  
- strengths  
- harder-to-see areas  
- stronger phrasing or leverage points  
- missing wins  
- next steps  

### 3. Next Steps  
The user leaves with 3–5 clear actions they can take this week.

The interface should feel like a crafted expert report, not a dashboard.

## SIGNATURE PATTERN

### Insight Stack  
A single column with one clear takeaway per section.

### Crafted Accents  
A thin accent line or subtle highlight used sparingly to guide the eye.

## CORE MODES

### Resume Studio  
The hero mode:
- score  
- summary  
- strengths  
- gaps  
- rewrites  
- missing wins  
- next steps  

### Offer Studio (planned)  
Negotiation clarity and leverage.

### Interview Story Studio (future)  
Story patterns and narrative strength.

Future ideas must reinforce clarity, confidence, and craft.

## PRODUCT EMOTION

We reduce anxiety and build grounded confidence.

Typical emotional arc:
1. “I’m unsure how I read.”  
2. “This sees me clearly.”  
3. “I understand what’s strong vs thin.”  
4. “I know exactly what to do next.”  
5. “I feel better about my story.”

Users should leave feeling:
- seen  
- understood  
- more confident  
- clear about next steps
