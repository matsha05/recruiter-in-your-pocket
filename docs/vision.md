# Recruiter in Your Pocket — Product Vision

**Last Updated:** December 2025

## IDENTITY

Recruiter in Your Pocket is a small, elite, recruiter-owned studio for your story.

It should read like a high-end tool, not a generic AI builder.

**Core promise:** We tell you how you read and exactly how to sharpen the story.

The experience should feel:
- crafted, not generic
- confident, not tentative
- joyfully clear, not sterile

Clarity is our foundation. Confidence and small moments of delight sit on top of it.

## CORE EXPERIENCE

The rhythm: upload/paste in workspace → get a crafted read → stronger bullets → next steps.

### 1. Input
User brings something meaningful via the dedicated workspace:
- Resume (upload PDF/DOCX or paste text)
- Optional job description for alignment analysis (future)

### 2. Insight Stack
The heart of the product. For resumes:
- How your story reads at a glance
- What's working
- What's harder to see
- Stronger phrasing you can use
- Next steps

### 3. Export
PDF and Copy must feel as designed and intentional as the UI.

### 4. Next Steps
User leaves with 3–5 clear actions they can take this week.

The interface should feel like a crafted expert report, not a dashboard.

## LOGGED-IN EXPERIENCE

Users who log in get:
- Report history across sessions

## PAYWALL BEHAVIOR

Triggers: scroll into locked section or click locked control (Missing Wins, Export, see all rewrites).

Modal-only. Report stays visible behind. User may close and continue thin free report.

Flow: email → code → Stripe → auto-regenerate full report.

---

## PRODUCT EMOTION

We reduce anxiety and build grounded confidence.

Typical emotional arc:
1. "I'm anxious and unclear about how I read."
2. "This sees me clearly."
3. "I understand what's strong vs thin."
4. "I know exactly what to do next."
5. "I feel energized and better about my story."

Tone: calm hands + sharp eyes.

Users should leave feeling: seen, understood, more confident, clear about next steps.

## CORE MODES

### Resume Studio (live)
The hero mode:
- Crafted read on how your resume lands
- Strengths
- Gaps
- Rewrites
- Missing Wins
- Next steps

### Offer Studio (planned)
Negotiation clarity and leverage with its own Insight Stack. Parked until after launch.

### Future (only if user demand proves it)
- LinkedIn Profile Studio
- Interview Story Studio
- JD Matching

All studios share the same design language. Future ideas must reinforce clarity, confidence, and craft.

## DESIGN CONNECTION

This vision works with:
- `docs/design-principles.md`
- `docs/context.md`

Identity traits: crafted, confident, joyfully clear.

Anything that drifts from these traits should be reconsidered or removed.
