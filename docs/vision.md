# Recruiter in Your Pocket — Product Vision

## IDENTITY

Recruiter in Your Pocket is a small, elite, recruiter-owned studio for your story.  
It should read like a high-end tool, not a generic AI builder.  
Our core promise: we tell you how you read and exactly how to sharpen the story.

The experience should feel:
- crafted, not generic  
- confident, not tentative  
- joyfully clear, not sterile  

Clarity is our foundation.  
Confidence and small moments of delight sit on top of it.

## CORE EXPERIENCE

The rhythm is simple: paste → get a crafted read → stronger bullets → next steps.

### 1. Input
The user brings something meaningful:
- resume (today)  
- offer, outreach, interview context (future)  

### 2. Insight Stack  
The heart of the product. For resumes, it is:
- how your story reads at a glance  
- what’s working  
- what’s harder to see  
- stronger phrasing you can use  
- next steps  

### 3. Export with care  
PDF and Copy must feel as designed and intentional as the UI.

### 4. Next Steps  
The user leaves with 3–5 clear actions they can take this week.

The interface should feel like a crafted expert report, not a dashboard.

## SIGNATURE PATTERN

### Insight Stack  
A single column with one clear takeaway per section.

### Crafted Accents  
A thin accent line or subtle highlight used sparingly to guide the eye.

## CORE MODES

### Resume Studio (current)  
The hero mode, live today:
- crafted read on how your resume lands  
- strengths  
- gaps  
- rewrites  
- missing wins  
- next steps  

### Offer Studio (planned)  
Negotiation clarity and leverage with its own Insight Stack.

### Outreach Studio (future)  
Cold and warm outreach clarity with a tailored stack.

### Interview Story Studio (future)  
Story patterns and narrative strength with its own stack.

All studios share the same design language: spine, headings, cards, motion. Future ideas must reinforce clarity, confidence, and craft.

## PRODUCT EMOTION

We reduce anxiety and build grounded confidence.

Typical emotional arc:
1. “I’m anxious and unclear about how I read.”  
2. “This sees me clearly.”  
3. “I understand what’s strong vs thin.”  
4. “I know exactly what to do next.”  
5. “I feel energized and better about my story.”

Tone: calm hands + sharp eyes. Users should leave feeling:
- seen  
- understood  
- more confident  
- clear about next steps

## DESIGN CONNECTION

This vision works together with:
- `docs/design-principles.md`
- `context.md`

Identity traits:
- crafted  
- confident  
- joyfully clear  

Anything that drifts away from these traits should be reconsidered or removed.
