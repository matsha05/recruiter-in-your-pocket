## 1. Methodology v1 (Week 4 Publish)

### Outline

**Target:** 300-500 words, scannable, publishable by Week 4

```
# How We Analyze Your Resume

## The 6-Second Scan
Recruiters spend 6-7 seconds on their first pass. We simulate that scan 
and show you what stands out — and what gets missed.

## What We Look For

**Impact** — Did you move metrics? Build something? Change outcomes?
**Clarity** — Can a recruiter understand your role in 6 seconds?
**Story** — Does your career make sense? Is there a clear trajectory?
**Readability** — Is your resume easy to scan, or a wall of text?

## How We Score

We score resumes on a 0-100 scale based on how well they communicate 
to a recruiter doing a quick scan.

| Band | Score | What It Means |
|:-----|:------|:--------------|
| Needs Work | 50-69 | Core message is buried or unclear |
| Solid Foundation | 70-79 | Good bones, needs sharpening |
| Strong | 80-89 | Clear impact, minor polish needed |
| Excellent | 90-100 | Ready for competitive roles |

## What We Don't Do

- **We don't rewrite your resume.** You do. We show you what to fix.
- **We don't guarantee interviews.** Markets vary. We improve your odds.
- **We don't store your resume.** It's processed and deleted immediately.

## Our Quality System

Every prompt change we make is tested against a calibration set of 
real resumes before it reaches you. If quality drops, we don't ship.
```

**Word count:** ~230 words (expandable to 500 in Week 10)

## 2. Privacy Promise (Aligned with Data Handling Truth Table)

### Plain-Language Version

> **Your resume stays private.**
>
> When you upload your resume, we process it to generate your analysis — then delete the text immediately. We never store your raw resume. We never train AI on your content. We never share your data with anyone.
>
> **What we do store:**
> - Your analysis results (so you can see your history)
> - Your score and comments (for version comparison)
> - A hash of your resume (to detect duplicates, not readable)
>
> **What we never store:**
> - Your resume text
> - Your personal contact info (we don't extract it)
>
> You can delete all your data anytime in Settings. We use industry-standard encryption for everything in transit.
>
> We don't sell data — ever.

**Word count:** 118 words

### Trust Badge Version

"Encrypted • Deleted after analysis • Never trains AI"

you've managed and the hard trade-offs you've navigated."
