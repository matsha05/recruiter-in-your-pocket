## Why RIYP is Not a Feature

### The Feature Trap

Most AI resume tools are features waiting to be absorbed:
- "AI resume score" = commodity feature any platform can add
- "ATS optimization" = checkbox feature for job boards
- "Resume builder" = table stakes for career platforms

### RIYP's Wedge Clarity

RIYP is NOT a feature because:

| Dimension | Feature Mentality | RIYP Reality |
|:----------|:------------------|:-------------|
| **Positioning** | "AI-powered resume help" | "See what recruiters see in 7.4 seconds" |
| **Methodology** | Black box scoring | Visible recruiter-grade rubric with evidence |
| **Pricing** | Subscription commodity | Credit-based + lifetime credits = unique model |
| **Quality system** | Ad-hoc prompts | Calibrated eval harness + regression gates |
| **Tone** | Generic AI voice | Editorial human voice with strict constraints |

**Wedge summary:** RIYP simulates human recruiter judgment, not bot parsing. This is a perspective shift, not a feature.

## What is Defensible

### 1. Quality Engineering System (HIGH DEFENSIBILITY)

| Asset | Description | Why Hard to Copy |
|:------|:------------|:-----------------|
| **Calibration dataset** | 50-100 labeled resumes with expected scores | Requires sustained curation effort |
| **Eval harness** | Automated quality checks before deploy | Engineering investment, not just prompts |
| **Rubric calibration** | Score bands empirically validated | Domain expertise + iteration |
| **Regression gates** | Cannot ship if quality degrades | Operational discipline |

**Moat strength:** Medium-High. Competitors could theoretically build this, but few will invest the time. Creates acquisition-ready IP story.

### 2. Editorial Voice (MEDIUM DEFENSIBILITY)

| Asset | Description | Why Hard to Copy |
|:------|:------------|:-----------------|
| **Tone constraints** | Banned phrases, style rules | Requires taste, not just tech |
| **Few-shot examples** | Thin/strong/high-bar progressions | Domain expertise embedded |
| **Anti-corporate language** | Explicit list of banned phrases | Cultural decision, not algorithmic |

**Moat strength:** Medium. Voice is defensible but not structural. Can be copied with effort over 6-12 months.

### 3. Credit Pricing Model (LOW-MEDIUM DEFENSIBILITY)

| Asset | Description | Why Hard to Copy |
|:------|:------------|:-----------------|
| **Pay-per-use** | $9 single, $29 pack | Easy to copy |
| **Credits never expire** | Lifetime value | Operational choice |
| **No subscription** | Addresses fatigue | Market positioning |

**Moat strength:** Low-Medium. Easy to copy, but first-mover brand association helps. "The $9 resume review."

### 4. Chrome Extension + Workflow Presence (FUTURE DEFENSIBILITY)

| Asset | Description | Why Hard to Copy |
|:------|:------------|:-----------------|
| **Process-layer integration** | Always visible on job boards | Habit formation takes time |
| **JD capture workflow** | One-click from LinkedIn/Indeed | Table stakes once built, but takes time |
| **Quick match scoring** | Instant relevance signal | Unique implementation possible |

**Moat strength:** Medium (once built). Creates daily touchpoints and switching costs.

## What Would Disqualify Us

### Red Flags for Acquirers

| Disqualifier | Current Status | Mitigation |
|:-------------|:---------------|:-----------|
| **Score inconsistency** | Unknown until measured | Eval harness + calibration (Month 1) |
| **Generic AI output** | Prompt quality is strong | Tone checks in eval harness |
| **No retention mechanism** | Version comparison only | Chrome extension (Month 2) |
| **No quality system** | Missing | Building (Month 1-2) |
| **PII exposure** | Sentry config unknown | Audit + configure (Month 1) |
| **No user growth** | Pre-launch | Product Hunt + organic (Month 3) |

### Critical Path Items

1. **Quality system must exist** — Acquirer will ask "how do you prevent quality drift?"
2. **Retention data must exist** — Acquirer will ask "what's your D7/D30 retention?"
3. **Revenue data must exist** — Acquirer will ask "what's your conversion rate?"

## What We Need in 4 Weeks Post-Launch

### Metrics to Demonstrate

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|:-------|:-------|:---------------|
| **Reviews completed** | 1,000+ | Volume validates product-market fit |
| **Conversion rate** | 10-15% | Shows willingness to pay |
| **D7 retention** | 25%+ | Shows stickiness |
| **NPS score** | 40+ | Word-of-mouth potential |
| **Refund rate** | <5% | Quality concerns addressed |

### Proof to Demonstrate

| Proof | Target | How to Get |
|:------|:-------|:-----------|
| **User testimonials** | 10+ with permission | Email post-purchase, incentivize |
| **Before/after examples** | 5+ public-safe | Collect with permission |
| **Quality system evidence** | Eval pass rate 100% | Screenshot of passing runs |
| **Methodology documentation** | Public page | Already exists, polish |

## Acquirer Profile

### Likely Interested Parties

| Type | Examples | What They'd Value |
|:-----|:---------|:------------------|
| **HR Tech platforms** | Deel, Gusto, Rippling | AI resume capability + credit model |
| **Job boards** | Indeed, LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter | Premium feature add-on |
| **Career services** | VMock, Career.io | Differentiated analysis engine |
| **AI companies** | Jasper, Copy.ai | Vertical application expertise |

### What They'd Pay For

1. **Unique positioning** — "Recruiter Lens" is distinct in crowded market
2. **Quality engineering** — Eval harness + calibration = professional operation
3. **Credit model** — Acquirable without subscription churn headache
4. **User base** — Growth trajectory matters more than absolute numbers

## Acquisition Narrative

### The Pitch (60 seconds)

> RIYP is not another AI resume tool. We simulate what recruiters see in 7.4 seconds, not what ATS bots parse.
>
> Our quality system includes calibrated scoring with regression gates—we cannot ship a prompt change unless it passes our eval harness. This creates IP that goes beyond prompts.
>
> Our credit pricing addresses subscription fatigue—users pay $9 once, not $50/month. This drives high conversion and clean revenue without churn.
>
> We're building the Chrome extension that makes us visible on every job board. That's the retention lock.
>
> In 3 months, we'll have: quality system live, Chrome extension shipped, and early user metrics proving product-market fit.

### What Makes Us Strategic-Buyer-Worthy

1. **Unique wedge** in commoditized category
2. **Quality infrastructure** that proves engineering seriousness
3. **Credit model** that's acquirable without subscription complexity
4. **Clear roadmap** (extension, retention, potential negotiation module)
