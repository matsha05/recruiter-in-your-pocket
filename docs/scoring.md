# Resume Scoring Rubric

- **90–100** — Top-tier for their lane. Clear ownership, strong context, and visible impact throughout. Hire-ready.
- **80–89** — Strong story with real impact and ownership. Minor clarity gaps; solid for good roles.
- **70–79** — Good foundation. Impact exists but parts are buried or uneven. Needs sharpening before serious roles.
- **60–69** — Mixed clarity. Some outcomes but scope/ownership are hard to see. Needs tightening and added context.
- **50–59** — Limited signal or unclear role/impact. Needs significant rewrite and framing to be competitive.
- **Below 50** — Very low signal or major clarity gaps. Needs substantial rebuild before review-ready.

Notes:
- Scores must be integers from 0 to 100.
- Do not inflate; 80+ should feel genuinely strong in real markets.
- Calibrate to the candidate’s domain and seniority, not to generic expectations.
