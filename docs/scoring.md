# Resume scoring rubric

The score is a 0 to 100 view of how well your resume tells a clear, focused, evidence-based story for the roles you want.

The goal is not perfection. The goal is an honest, recruiter-calibrated signal: "If I read this quickly in a real pipeline, how strong would it feel?"

## Dimensions and weights

The model considers five dimensions:

1. Impact & outcomes (30)
   - Clear business, mission, or team outcomes.
   - Uses metrics, scale, or before/after language when appropriate.
   - Shows how work moved the needle, not just what tasks were done.

2. Relevance & focus (25)
   - Content is aligned with the target role or family of roles.
   - Headline and top of page frame the right story.
   - Older or less relevant experience is present but de-emphasized.

3. Clarity & structure (20)
   - Sections are well labeled and easy to scan.
   - Bullets are concise and focused on one idea each.
   - Titles, companies, dates, and locations are clear and consistent.

4. Evidence & ownership (15)
   - Uses language that shows ownership: "I led, drove, delivered" when true.
   - Connects actions to outcomes instead of listing responsibilities only.
   - Avoids vague phrasing such as "helped with", "involved in", or "various tasks".

5. Craft & polish (10)
   - Formatting is consistent: spacing, bullets, tense, capitalization.
   - No obvious spelling or grammar issues.
   - Overall presentation feels intentional and professional.

Scores are not a strict formula, but the model is guided to stay within these weights.

## Score bands

These anchors guide both the model and human reviewers.

- **0–49 – Not ready yet**
  - Hard to follow, very generic, or missing key sections.
  - Impact is rarely visible.
  - Would likely struggle to get a fair read in a real funnel.

- **50 – Barely working**
  - The resume is understandable but messy or generic.
  - Light or inconsistent impact.
  - Needs significant revision before sending to top companies.

- **60–69 – Developing**
  - A clear story is emerging.
  - Some good bullets, but many are still vague or redundant.
  - A good base that needs focused tightening.

- **70 – Solid foundation**
  - Structure works, story is clear.
  - Impact shows up in several places.
  - With targeted edits, this could become a strong resume.

- **75–84 – Strong**
  - Consistent impact and relevance.
  - Most sections are sharp and scannable.
  - This resume would not be the reason for a rejection.

- **85 – Very strong**
  - Clear, focused, and outcome driven.
  - Good balance of scope, mechanism, and impact.
  - Competitive for many top roles and companies.

- **92 – Exceptional**
  - Rare level of clarity and impact.
  - Nearly every bullet earns its place.
  - Very little low-hanging fruit remains.

- **93–100 – Rare**
  - Reserved for resumes that feel unusually clear and compelling.
  - The bar should be extremely high here.
