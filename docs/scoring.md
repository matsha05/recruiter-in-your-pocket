# Resume scoring rubric

The score is a 0 to 100 view of how well your resume tells a clear, focused, evidence-based story for the roles you want.

The goal is not perfection. The goal is an honest, recruiter-calibrated signal: "If I read this quickly in a real pipeline, how strong would it feel?"

The score is a clarity signal, not a judgment. Bands are calibrated to how clearly a recruiter can understand your story on a first read.

## Dimensions and weights

The model considers five dimensions:

1. Impact & outcomes (30)
   - Clear business, mission, or team outcomes.
   - Uses metrics, scale, or before/after language when appropriate.
   - Shows how work moved the needle, not just what tasks were done.

2. Relevance & focus (25)
   - Content is aligned with the target role or family of roles.
   - Headline and top of page frame the right story.
   - Older or less relevant experience is present but de-emphasized.

3. Clarity & structure (20)
   - Sections are well labeled and easy to scan.
   - Bullets are concise and focused on one idea each.
   - Titles, companies, dates, and locations are clear and consistent.

4. Evidence & ownership (15)
   - Uses language that shows ownership: "I led, drove, delivered" when true.
   - Connects actions to outcomes instead of listing responsibilities only.
   - Avoids vague phrasing such as "helped with", "involved in", or "various tasks".

5. Craft & polish (10)
   - Formatting is consistent: spacing, bullets, tense, capitalization.
   - No obvious spelling or grammar issues.
   - Overall presentation feels intentional and professional.

Scores are not a strict formula, but the model is guided to stay within these weights.

## Score bands

These anchors guide both the model and human reviewers.

- **60–69 – Not ready**  
  Story is unclear. Bullets feel busy or generic. Outcomes are missing or weak. Structure hides signal.

- **70–77 – Thin signal**  
  Base is solid but impact is muted. Ownership is soft. Outcomes exist but are inconsistent or too light.

- **78–84 – Strong foundation**  
  Clear ownership and value. Some bullets drift or overexplain. Signal is strong but not consistently sharp.

- **85–91 – High bar**  
  High signal. Scope, ownership, and outcomes land cleanly. Minor clarity edits would make this elite.

- **92–100 – Rare air**  
  Elite signal. Every bullet carries weight, focus, and measurable impact. No noise. No drift.
