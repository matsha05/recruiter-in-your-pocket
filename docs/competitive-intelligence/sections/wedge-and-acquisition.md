## Part 1: Wedge Opportunities

### Wedge 1: "Recruiter Lens" (PRIMARY—ACTIVE)

**What it is:**
Simulate human recruiter judgment in 7.4 seconds, not ATS bot parsing. Show users what HUMANS see, not what machines parse.

**Why it wins:**
| Advantage | Evidence |
|:----------|:---------|
| No competitor does this well | Jobscan/Teal/Resume Worded all focus on ATS keywords |
| Addresses user paradox | "AI optimizes for bots, I get rejected by humans" |
| Creates emotional resonance | "Oh shit, I was burying the lead" |
| Justifies premium positioning | Expert judgment > algorithmic matching |

**What must be true in product:**
- [x] Prompt explicitly simulates recruiter perspective (verified in prompt)
- [x] Output focuses on "first impression" and readability
- [x] Tone is human, not robotic
- [x] Scoring feels calibrated to real hiring decisions

**Defensibility:**
| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|:-------|:-------|:------|
| Brand/positioning | Medium-High | Can be copied with effort |
| Prompt engineering | Medium | Sophisticated but not patentable |
| User trust | High | Built through consistency over time |
| Data flywheel | Low currently | Not yet leveraging aggregate patterns |

**Feasibility:** ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

**Risks:**
- Competitors could copy positioning within 6-12 months
- Requires ongoing prompt refinement to maintain quality
- No structural moat (AI, not data)

---

### Wedge 2: Credit-Based Pricing (ACTIVE)

**What it is:**
$9 one-time vs. $30-50/month subscriptions. Pay per use, not per month.

**Why it wins:**
| Advantage | Evidence |
|:----------|:---------|
| Directly addresses subscription fatigue | #2 user complaint in research |
| Aligns with episodic job search | Users don't search 12 months/year |
| Lower barrier to trial | $9 < $29/month commitment |
| Clear value exchange | "I give $9, I get 1 review" |

**What must be true in product:**
- [x] Pricing is simple and visible
- [x] Free tier demonstrates full value
- [x] Credit purchase is frictionless
- [ ] Credits never expire (confirm messaging)

**Defensibility:**
| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|:-------|:-------|:------|
| Structural moat | Low | Easy to copy |
| First-mover brand | Medium | "The $9 resume review" association |
| User habit | Low | Will switch if better option exists |

**Feasibility:** ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

**Risks:**
- No recurring revenue (harder to forecast)
- Can be undercut by competitors
- May limit ARPU ceiling

### Wedge 3: Quality Engineering System (PROPOSED—P1)

**What it is:**
A defensible quality infrastructure including calibration datasets, eval harnesses, and regression testing for AI outputs.

**Why it wins:**
| Advantage | Evidence |
|:----------|:---------|
| Addresses "generic AI" complaint | #1 user complaint |
| Creates acquisition-ready IP | Engineering assets beyond prompts |
| Enables confident iteration | Change prompts without breaking quality |
| Differentiates from commoditized AI | "We have a quality system, not just GPT" |

**What must be true in product:**
- [ ] 50-100 resume calibration dataset
- [ ] Automated eval harness
- [ ] Regression tests before prompt changes
- [ ] Score stability across model updates

**Defensibility:**
| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|:-------|:-------|:------|
| Structural moat | Medium-High | Requires sustained investment |
| Competitive insight | Medium | Dataset reveals patterns |
| Acquisition story | High | "Engineering excellence" narrative |

**Feasibility:** 2-3 weeks to implement core system

**Risks:**
- Requires ongoing maintenance
- May reveal scoring inconsistencies initially
- Opportunity cost vs. features

---

### Wedge 4: Chrome Extension (ROADMAP—P1)

**What it is:**
Browser extension for job board integration with quick resume matching.

**Why it wins:**
| Advantage | Evidence |
|:----------|:---------|
| Creates process-layer presence | Teal, Simplify, Huntr all have extensions |
| Drives daily touchpoints | Extension is always visible |
| Enables "clip JD → match" workflow | Reduces friction for JD analysis |
| Increases retention | Process integration > product visits |

**What must be true in product:**
- [ ] Extension captures job descriptions
- [ ] Quick match score without full upload
- [ ] Links to full review from extension

**Defensibility:**
| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|:-------|:-------|:------|
| Structural moat | Low | Table stakes for Career OS |
| User habit | Medium | Once installed, sticky |
| Competitive parity | Required | Must have to compete |

**Feasibility:** 2-4 weeks depending on scope

**Risks:**
- Table stakes, not differentiator
- Chrome Web Store review process
- Maintenance burden

---

### Wedge 5: Negotiation Module (FUTURE—P3)

**What it is:**
Offer evaluation, market data comparison, and negotiation script generation.

**Why it wins:**
| Advantage | Evidence |
|:----------|:---------|
| High ROI for users | $X improvement = immediate value |
| Low competition in quality | Levels.fyi, Rora high-touch only |
| Justifies premium pricing | "Made back the cost 100x" |
| Natural expertise extension | "Principal Recruiter" knows negotiation |

**What must be true in product:**
- [ ] Comp data integration (or partnership)
- [ ] Script generation for common scenarios
- [ ] Confidence-building framing

**Defensibility:**
| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|:-------|:-------|:------|
| Domain expertise | Medium-High | Requires real knowledge |
| Data access | Medium | Comp data is gated |
| Trust compound | High | "They helped me get $20K more" |

**Feasibility:** 4-8 weeks for MVP
