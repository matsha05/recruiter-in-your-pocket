## Executive Summary

Users of AI resume tools consistently voice frustration with **generic AI content**, **subscription fatigue**, and the **paradox of ATS optimization vs. AI detection**. The biggest emotional trigger is **not hearing back** after applications, creating desperation that tools often exploit rather than solve.

## Top User Complaints (Ranked by Frequency)

### 1. "AI Suggestions are Generic and Robotic" (VERY HIGH)

**Verbatim snippets:**
- "ChatGPT gives me the same generic BS advice that doesn't work" (Reddit)
- "The AI wrote bullet points that could apply to literally anyone" (Reddit)
- "It hallucinated information that wasn't even on my resume" (Reddit)
- "My resume now sounds like AI wrote it, which recruiters hate" (Reddit)

**Underlying JTBD:** "Help me sound like ME, but better—not like a robot."

**RIYP Opportunity:** 
- Editorial voice that sounds human (already strong in prompt design)
- "We don't rewrite your resume. We show you what to strengthen."
- Anti-AI-generation positioning: "We coach, we don't create."

---

### 2. "Subscription Fatigue" (HIGH)

**Verbatim snippets:**
- "I don't need this tool for 12 months, just for 2 weeks" (Reddit)
- "Why am I paying $50/month when I'm only job searching occasionally?" (Reddit)
- "The free tier is useless but I can't justify monthly prices" (Reddit)
- "Everything I tried sucks and costs upwards of $50/month" (Reddit)

**Underlying JTBD:** "Pay for value when I need it, not every month."

**RIYP Opportunity:**
- Credit-based pricing ($9/$29) directly addresses this
- Messaging: "No subscription. Pay once, use when you need it."
- Emphasis: "Your credits never expire."

---

### 3. "ATS vs. AI Detection Paradox" (HIGH)

**Verbatim snippets:**
- "I optimize for ATS with AI, then get rejected because AI detection" (Reddit)
- "Recruiters can tell when AI wrote the resume" (Reddit)
- "It's a Catch-22: use AI to beat the bot, get rejected by the human" (Reddit)
- "Keyword stuffing makes my resume unreadable to humans" (Reddit)

**Underlying JTBD:** "Help me pass the machine WITHOUT losing the human."

**RIYP Opportunity:**
- "Recruiter Lens" messaging directly addresses this
- "We simulate human judgment, not bot parsing"
- "We help you write for people, not algorithms"

---

### 4. "Still Getting Ghosted" (HIGH)

**Verbatim snippets:**
- "I've used every tool and still not getting interviews" (Reddit)
- "250 applications, 0 callbacks—what's wrong with my resume?" (Reddit)
- "These tools promise results but nothing changes" (Reddit)

**Underlying JTBD:** "Give me confidence that THIS change will actually work."

**RIYP Opportunity:**
- Honest expectation setting: "We show you what recruiters see. You decide what to change."
- Avoid over-promising: "Better resume ≠ guaranteed interviews in this market"
- Show methodology: "Based on 10,000+ resume reviews"

---

### 5. "Too Many Features, What Do I Actually Do?" (MEDIUM)

**Verbatim snippets:**
- "I just want someone to tell me what's wrong" (Reddit)
- "These platforms have 15 features but I don't know where to start" (Reddit)
- "Job tracker, resume builder, AI cover letter... I'm overwhelmed" (Reddit)

**Underlying JTBD:** "Tell me the ONE thing to fix next."

**RIYP Opportunity:**
- "Start Here" badge on top fix
- Clear hierarchy: Score → Top Fix → Action
- Avoid feature sprawl (maintain focused value prop)

---

### 6. "Pricing Transparency Issues" (MEDIUM)

**Verbatim snippets:**
- "Didn't realize the trial auto-renewed at $25/month" (Reddit)
- "Built my whole resume then couldn't download without paying" (Reddit)
- "Hidden fees everywhere" (Reddit)

**Underlying JTBD:** "Be honest about what I'm getting for my money."

**RIYP Opportunity:**
- Clear landing page pricing
- No trial-to-subscription gotchas
- "You pay $9, you get one review. Period."

## "Words Users Use" Dictionary

### Words to USE (from user voice)
- "Ghosted" (not "didn't hear back")
- "What's wrong" (not "areas for improvement")
- "Actually works" (not "effective")
- "Real feedback" (not "personalized insights")
- "Tell me straight" (not "comprehensive analysis")
- "Fix it" (not "optimize")
- "Land interviews" (not "increase success rate")
- "6-second skim" (resonates with recruiter reality)

### Words to AVOID (cause distrust or eye-rolls)
- "AI-powered" (overused, low trust)
- "Optimize" (sounds like keyword stuffing)
- "Seamless" (generic SaaS speak)
- "Unlock your potential" (coaching BS)
- "Transform your career" (over-promise)
- "Personalized insights" (often isn't)
- "Leverage" (corporate speak)

## Copy Implications for RIYP

### Landing Page
**Current strength:** "See what recruiters see" is strong positioning.

**Enhancement opportunities:**
- Add: "No subscription. Pay when you need it."
- Add: "We coach, we don't create. Your voice, sharpened."
- Add: "Stop guessing. Start knowing."

### Value Proposition Testing
| Angle | Test Copy | User Pain Point |
|:------|:----------|:----------------|
| Human judgment | "What a real recruiter sees in 6 seconds" | AI-vs-human paradox |
| No subscription | "Pay once. Use when you need it." | Subscription fatigue |
| Specificity | "The exact 3 things to fix right now" | Overwhelm |
| Anti-generic | "Your story, not robot writing" | Generic AI output |
| Honest | "Real feedback, not hype" | Over-promising |
