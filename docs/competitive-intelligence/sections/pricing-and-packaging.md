## 2. Price Anchors by Segment

### 2.1 Price Psychology

| User Mindset | Price Anchor | Willingness to Pay | Products |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------|
| "I need to beat ATS" | $30-50/mo | High (desperation) | Jobscan, Resume Worded |
| "I want one tool for everything" | $25-40/mo | Medium (efficiency) | Teal, Huntr |
| "Write my resume for me" | $15-30/mo | Medium | Kickresume, Rezi |
| "I need help right now" | $9-30 one-time | High | RIYP (unique positioning) |
| "I can't afford monthly" | $0-10 | Low (will churn) | FlowCV, free tiers |
| "This is high-stakes" | $100-500+ | Very high | Final Round, Levels.fyi |

### 2.2 Subscription Fatigue Signal

**Evidence from user research (Reddit):**
- "I only need this for 2 weeks during my job search"
- "Why am I paying $50/month when not actively looking?"
- "Everything costs upwards of $50/month"

**Implication for RIYP:**
- Credit-based model directly addresses fatigue
- $9 feels affordable for episodic use
- $29 for 5 creates "stock up" behavior

```
                        HIGH PRICE
                            │
          ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
          │   Final Round   │    Jobscan      │
          │   ($96/mo)      │    ($50/mo)     │
          │                 │                 │
   BUILDER│─────────────────┼─────────────────│REVIEWER
          │                 │                 │
          │   Kickresume    │    RIYP         │
          │   ($19/mo)      │    ($9 once)    │
          │   FlowCV ($4)   │                 │
