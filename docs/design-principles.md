# DESIGN PRINCIPLES

## 1. Crafted  
Every element feels intentional and premium:
- purposeful typography  
- strong hierarchy  
- dependable spacing rhythm  
- subtle depth or motion used sparingly  
- nothing accidental or generic  

Crafted ≠ busy.  
Crafted = designed with care.

---

## 2. Confident  
The product must speak with the tone of a world-class recruiter:
- clear  
- direct  
- steady  
- decisive  

Confidence is conveyed through:
- strong headings  
- focused structure  
- uncluttered layouts  
- meaningful accenting  
- minimal cognitive load  

No apologetic language.  
No corporate vagueness.  
No ambiguity.

---

## 3. Joyful Clarity  
Clarity does not mean dull.

We intentionally include small moments of delight that make users feel:
- seen  
- energized  
- capable  
- emotionally lighter  

Examples:
- a tasteful accent color  
- a gentle reveal animation  
- meaningful whitespace  
- microcopy that feels warm instead of flat  

Joy is earned, not decorative.

---

## 4. No Noise  
Avoid anything that introduces chaos or cheapness:
- neon  
- glow effects  
- gamer gradients  
- crowded borders  
- decorative icons without meaning  
- loud animations  

Premium ≠ flashy.  
Premium = intentional, clean, expressive.

---

## 5. Human and Approachable  
The UI must work for all backgrounds:  
tech, retail, ministry, nonprofit, legal, education.

We prioritize:
- readable type  
- predictable spacing  
- warmth over formality  
- simple, honest language  

Users should feel welcomed and understood.

---

## 6. Insight First  
Users come for clarity about their resume.

Make the insight stack unmistakable:
- clear section headings  
- clean spacing  
- strong first-take summaries  
- no elements competing with insight  
- the main takeaway visible in one second  

If something doesn’t help the user understand their story faster, remove it.

---

## 7. Premium Over Perfect  
We favor:
- clarity over polish paralysis  
- crafted moments over sterile minimalism  
- confidence over neutrality  
- expressive restraint over flatness  

The product should feel alive, not mechanical.

---

## 8. Consistency Builds Trust  
Codex must maintain consistent:
- spacing  
- typography rules  
- ordering of insights  
- interaction patterns  
- tone and microcopy  
- accent usage  

Predictability = ease.  
Ease builds trust.

---

# EXPERIENCE PRINCIPLES

## 1. Deliver Insight That Feels True  
The emotional “wow” comes from:
- honest reads  
- sharper bullets  
- clear strengths  
- fixable gaps  

Design supports insight rather than competing with it.

---

## 2. Build Confidence  
Users should leave thinking:
> “I understand how I read. I know exactly what to fix. And I feel better than when I started.”

Design should reinforce emotional lift.

---

## 3. Delight Without Distraction  
Use subtle, tasteful expressions:
- soft depth  
- light hover motion  
- slight accent shift  
- micro animations < 200ms  
- one meaningful color accent  

Delight must support understanding, not distract from it.

---

## 4. Respect the Emotional State  
Job seeking is vulnerable.

Copy stays:
- warm  
- honest  
- direct  
- supportive  

Never corporate.  
Never hyped.  
Never fluffy.

---

## 5. End Every Session With Momentum  
Users should feel their next move is obvious and achievable.

---

# SIGNATURE PATTERN

## 1. Insight Stack  
A single vertical stack of:
- Score  
- How your story lands  
- Strengths  
- Harder-to-see areas  
- Stronger phrasing  
- Enhancement notes  
- Next steps  

Each section has one obvious takeaway.

## 2. Signature Accent  
A refined accent (line or highlight) used sparingly and intentionally to guide the eye.  
Not decorative.  
Not overused.

The layout and tone should feel like a crafted report from an expert — not a dashboard.

---

# COLOR, DEPTH & MOTION RULES

- One primary accent color; intentional and premium  
- Soft depth allowed  
- Gentle gradients allowed if subtle and high-end  
- Micro-animations allowed under 200ms for clarity or reinforcement  
- No neon  
- No heavy glow  
- No confetti or playful celebrations  
- Motion must be functional, not decorative  
- Color reinforces meaning; never noise  

Litmus test:  
If removing it improves clarity, it was noise.

# HOW TO APPLY THESE PRINCIPLES
- Does this increase clarity or confidence?  
- Does this feel intentionally crafted?  
- Does this spark a small moment of joy or momentum?  
- Does it reduce cognitive load?  
- Does it match the Insight Stack rules?  
- Is this a premium design decision or decoration?  
- When unsure: simplify, clarify, and express confidence.
