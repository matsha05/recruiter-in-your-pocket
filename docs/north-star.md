# Recruiter in Your Pocket — Report North Star

These rules protect the core report experience. Keep them stable across versions.

## Report flow
- Always use this order: How your resume reads → What’s working → What’s harder to see → Stronger phrasing you can use → Next steps.
- Each heading carries a muted framing line to set user expectations.

## Summary
- One short, cohesive paragraph (no bullet lists).
- Pattern to guide tone/structure:
  - “You come across as a strong [role/strength] with solid experience in [X] and [Y].”
  - “A recruiter will notice [positives] right away.”
  - “The piece that’s less clear is [gap], and highlighting it would make your impact easier to see.”
- Tone: calm, clean, premium, recruiter-truth, no hype, no em dashes.

## Rewrites
- Presented in two clusters only:
  - Clarity & Conciseness
  - Impact, Scope & Ownership
- Within each rewrite: Original / Better / “If you have it, include:”
- Do not show per-item category labels beyond the two clusters.

## Next steps
- Always show these four bullets, in this order:
  1) Split multi idea bullets so your role and impact are clearer.
  2) Add numbers or specific outcomes where they strengthen the story.
  3) Highlight your ownership in key achievements so your contribution stands out.
  4) Remember to make your strongest work easy to spot. Most recruiters will make a yes, no, or maybe decision within a few seconds.

## Visual/tone guardrails
- Calm, minimal, premium; reuse existing spacing/typography.
- Framing lines are light, descriptive, and secondary to the main headings.
- No new decorative styles; preserve the editorial, studio-grade feel.
