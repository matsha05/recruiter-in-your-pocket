# Recruiter in Your Pocket — Report North Star

These rules protect the core resume report experience.  
They should remain stable as the product evolves.

**North Star:** Give job seekers a crafted, recruiter-grade read of how their story lands, plus specific, doable moves to sharpen it — in under a minute.

---

## REPORT FLOW

Always use this order:

1. **How your resume reads**  
2. **What’s working**  
3. **What’s harder to see**  
4. **Stronger phrasing you can use**  
5. **Next steps**

Each section has one clear takeaway and should be easy to skim.

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Seen: “This really gets my story.”
- Clear: “I know what’s working and what’s not.”
- Energized: “I actually want to update my resume now.”
- Impressed: “This feels like a serious tool I’d pay for.”

---

## SURFACE CRITERIA
The product surface (web + PDF + copy) feels:
- premium  
- coherent  
- energetic but not noisy  
- like something you’d share with a mentor  

---

## SUMMARY

One short, cohesive paragraph (not a list).  
Tone should feel like a confident recruiter speaking directly to the user.

Pattern:
1. “You come across as a strong [role/strength] with solid experience in [X] and [Y].”  
2. “A recruiter will notice [positives] right away.”  
3. “What’s less obvious is [gap], and making that clearer will help your impact land faster.”  

Tone:
- crafted  
- confident  
- grounded  
- warm enough to land  
- no hype, no corporate speak, no em dashes  

---

## STRENGTHS

Strengths should:
- name real signals (ownership, scope, outcomes, environment)  
- avoid generic praise  
- help users see what is already working  

3–6 strengths is typical.

---

## HARDER-TO-SEE AREAS

This section surfaces:
- buried impact  
- unclear outcomes  
- vague or multi-idea bullets  
- missing scope  

The tone is honest without being harsh.  
Frame issues as “harder to see,” not “weaknesses.”

---

## STRONGER PHRASING YOU CAN USE

Two clusters only:
1. **Clarity & conciseness**  
2. **Impact, scope & ownership**

Each rewrite block includes:
- Original  
- Better  
- “If you have it, include:”  

Rewrites must:
- preserve nouns and truth  
- avoid invention  
- produce crisp, realistic upgrades

---

## NEXT STEPS

Give the user momentum.  
3–4 actions they can complete in one or two editing sessions.

Examples:
- Split multi-idea bullets  
- Add outcomes or scope where missing  
- Clarify ownership in major achievements  
- Ensure the strongest work is front-loaded for quick skim  

Users should finish thinking:
> “I know exactly what to do next.”

## VISUAL & TONE PRINCIPLES

The report experience should feel:
- **crafted** (intentional, premium, thought-through)  
- **confident** (clear hierarchy, decisive structure)  
- **joyfully clear** (uplifting touches without noise)  
- **grounded and human** (real recruiter energy)  

Use accents, spacing, and subtle motion to guide the eye — not to decorate.

Avoid:
- neon  
- gamer glow  
- loud gradients  
- hyperactive animation  

Favor:
- clean lines  
- clear hierarchy  
- subtle delight  
- thoughtful rhythm
