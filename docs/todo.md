This is the working checklist for turning the app from a good MVP into a premium, studio-grade product. master-roadmap.md stays the high-level source of truth; todo.md is the execution view for builders.

## Tier 5 – Hero & Trust Surface Polish

Goal: The hero should support the experience, not distract or feel like a template.

### T5.1 Hero cleanup
- [ ] Tighten spacing and typography for a more crafted, intentional premium studio feel
- [ ] Assess gradients - keep atmosphere gradients (0.08–0.12 opacity) that support premium feel, remove noise (effects that compete with content)

### T5.2 Primary path dominance
- [ ] Make the path "paste → run" absolutely obvious

### T5.3 Trust cues
- [ ] Data-handling visible and credible (verify it's prominent enough)
- [ ] Add optional "How scoring works" microline or tooltip

**Definition of Done:**  
A first-time visitor understands what it does, why it's trustworthy, and how to start — without feeling marketed to.
