                Most resume tools lean on myths about bots and secret filters. Recruiter in Your Pocket is built on how
                recruiters actually read resumes and decide who moves forward.

            We use hiring and usability research to shape how our product works, how we score your resume, and which
            changes
            we recommend first.

        <h2 class="research-section-title">Three studies that shape our approach</h2>

                <div class="research-card-title">How recruiters skim resumes in 6 seconds</div>
                <p class="research-card-excerpt">
                    Eye tracking research shows that recruiters spend only a few seconds on their initial fit or no fit
                    decision.
                    They focus on titles, companies, dates, and the first signals of scope.

                <div class="research-card-takeaway">
                    We use this to design <strong>Recruiter First Impression</strong> and decide what our main score
                    should measure.

                <p class="research-card-excerpt">
                    Usability research on reading patterns shows that people scan pages rather than reading every word.
                    They pay
                    special attention to headings, bullets, numbers, and names.

                <p class="research-card-excerpt">
                    The claim that "75% of resumes are never read" comes from marketing, not credible hiring data.
                    Modern ATS
                    tools mostly parse and organize resumes, not silently delete them.

                <div class="research-card-takeaway">
                    We use this to avoid fear-based messaging and focus on <strong>human clarity</strong> instead.

        <h2 class="research-section-title">How this shapes Recruiter in Your Pocket</h2>

        <ul class="research-bullets">
            <li><strong>Recruiter First Impression</strong> models the first few seconds where a recruiter decides
                whether to
                move you forward or move on.</li>
            <li>Our <strong>main score</strong> focuses on clarity, scope, and story, not keyword stuffing.</li>
            <li><strong>Bullet Upgrades</strong> are designed to match how eyes actually scan impact, numbers, and
                verbs.</li>
            <li>Our <strong>ATS education</strong> is honest and simple. We keep your resume parser friendly and
                recruiter
                clear instead of selling tricks.</li>
        </ul>
