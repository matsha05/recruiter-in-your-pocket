# Recruiter in Your Pocket

**High-stakes resume feedback from the perspective of an elite recruiter.**

Most resume tools are generic. They tell you to "add action verbs."
**Recruiter in Your Pocket** is different. It reads your resume like a Partner at a top firm—someone who has hired 1000+ people at Google, OpenAI, and startups. It tells you the truth about how you land, what's buried, and how to fix it to get the interview.

2.  **Critical Miss:** The one thing holding you back from the "Yes" pile.
