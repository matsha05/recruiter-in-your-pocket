# Recruiter in Your Pocket

**Get resume feedback from someone who's actually hired 1000+ people.**

Most resume advice is generic. "Use action verbs." "Quantify your achievements." You've heard it.

Recruiter in Your Pocket is different. It reads your resume like a real recruiter—someone who's made hiring decisions at Google, Facebook, OpenAI, and startups—and tells you exactly how you land: what's working, what's buried, and how to phrase things so hiring managers actually notice.

## What You Get

- **Your Score** — A clear read on how your resume lands, with a one-line verdict
- **What's Working** — The strengths that are already coming through
- **What's Harder to See** — The gaps that might be hurting you (with fixes)
- **Stronger Phrasing** — Before/after rewrites for your weakest bullets
- **Next Steps** — Exactly what to fix first

Everything exports to a **beautiful PDF** you can share with mentors, friends, or just keep for yourself.

## Why It's Different

We don't give generic advice that could apply to anyone. We read *your* story and tell you specifically what's buried, what's muted, and what could hit harder.

The goal isn't just to "fix your resume." It's to make you feel:
- **Relief** — "Finally, someone tells me the truth."
- **Resolve** — "I know exactly what to fix."
- **Excitement** — "I actually want to apply now."

## Privacy

Your resume text stays in your browser until you request feedback. We don't store resumes. Period.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Frontend:** Static HTML/JS (no build step)
- **PDF Generation:** Puppeteer
- **AI:** OpenAI GPT-4
