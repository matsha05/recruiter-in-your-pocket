# Recruiter in Your Pocket

Recruiter in Your Pocket is a tiny, high-end “resume studio” that reads your resume like a recruiter, then hands you a crafted report: how you read, what’s working, what’s harder to see, stronger bullets, and simple next steps. It includes a beautiful PDF export and plain-text report copy designed for sharing.

## Features
- Insight Stack: how you read, what’s working, what’s harder to see, stronger phrasing, next steps.
- PDF export: designed, share-ready report that mirrors the UI.
- Copy report: plain-text version for quick sharing.
- Trust: no resume storage; text stays in your browser until you request feedback.

## Tech stack
- Node/Express backend.
- Static HTML/JS frontend (no build step).
- Puppeteer for PDF generation.

- Design principles: `docs/design-principles.md`
